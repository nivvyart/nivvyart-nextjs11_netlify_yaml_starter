This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- -p 3050 (or no port)
```

Open [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050) with your browser to see the result.

Loosely based on blog post:
https://dev.to/siddharthroy/build-a-free-blog-with-nextjs-and-netlify-cms-125h

This doesnt have Blog setup, its for building a simple static site with a backend to change text/content on pages. Would be simple to add the blog feature.

You will need to connect to Netlify and do the config there to make sure backend works.
